# Advent of Code 2024

Since Advent of Code 2024 started while learning go, I decided to pause 2015 and start 2024. Please see the my [Advent-of-Code-2024](https://github.com/Mattrobby/Advent-of-Code-2024) repo or pull submodules if you want to see these solutions: 

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
